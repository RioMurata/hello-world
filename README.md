Hello there! I'm delighted and excited to have joined the Brightcove team!

Most recently I was working in the field of social advertising at Brand Networks. As a Senior Media Analyst my task was to plan, execute and manage clients' social media advertising campaigns to maximise the impact across all platforms.

Previously I spent several years for Lyris Technologies Inc, an email service provier, as a Professional Services Engineer to provide custom solutions for online retailers.

Originally from Japan, I'm a Londoner now having been living here for some time. It's a great city to live and work in and I really enjoy what is on offer here.

In my free time I love chilling out in galleries, doing yoga and generally eating a lot of chocolate!
